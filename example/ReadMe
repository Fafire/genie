This folder contains two examples for GPU search

example.cu: This is an exapmle for the kNN search on the SIFT feature data, one line for one SIFT features

example_tweets.cu: This is an exaple for kNN search on the tweets data, one line is for one tweet. The interger of each line represents a encoded word

example_adaptiveThreshold.cu: This is an exaple for kNN search with adaptiveThreshold. A Count Heap method is use to support large number of queries for top-k query

*_binary.cu: All files whose name end like this are merely different from above files on the input. The data input is from binary files.

convert_csv2binary.cu: This file can be compiled to an executable file whose name is convert. Use convert to turn csv files to binary files.
                        Convert usage:  ./convert [-a|-t] csvfilename binaryfilename
                                -a: append writing
                                -t: trunc writing
                                default: trunc writing


The binary file: Every binary file consists of 4 consecutive parts. 
                The first part: item_num, length = sizeof(unsigned int) ------ hold the number of data item
                The second part: row_num, length = sizeof(unsigned int) ------ hold the number of row of data
                The third part: data, length = sizeof(int) * item_num ------ hold actual data array
                The fourth part: index, length = sizeof(unsigned int) * row_num ----- hold row index array, which help determine the beginning of each row


to run:
first type make, and then run ./example_bin or ./example_tweets_bin
