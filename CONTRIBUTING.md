# Contributing to GENIE

This document describes how GENIE is developed and released.

## Development

The `master` branch is the main development branch. For new features, create
a separate branch. When merging the features, first rebase the branch from
`master`, then submit a pull request for peer reviews.

Make sure the commits are meaningful, you could adjust your commits with rebase.

## Release

The `release` branch is for releasing GENIE publicly. Once the features are
ready in the `master` branch, it could be merged to the `release` branch.
The `release` branch is then pushed to the `SeSaMe-NUS/genie` repo.
